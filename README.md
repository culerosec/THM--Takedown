# THM--Takedown

This was a fantastic CTF. I have uploaded the python scripts I used to exploit the C2 and pivot to the agent.
Code isnt perfect, just enough to get the job done. You probably need to make edits to serve your needs. 
Exploits LFI, Enumerates Agent ID's, and reverse shells from C2 server as well as the single bot checking into the C2.
